# Insurance ML Prediction Project

This is a personal project to build an end-to-end data pipeline and machine learning model to predict insurance outcomes (like churn, fraud, or claims).

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Raw and cleaned datasets
- `scripts/`: ETL and model training scripts
- `models/`: Saved ML models
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploration
- `dashboards/`: Visual dashboards (Streamlit or Power BI)

## Goal
Predict whether a customer will buy insurance, churn, or claim fraud using machine learning.

## Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, SQL, Streamlit/Power BI
